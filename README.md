I'm a senior year student at [KIIT University](https://kiit.ac.in/). I love connecting with new people and I adore the ones who share a vision to impact the world in a positive way. You can find me usually sipping up a coffee or probably reading a novel. I love to write beautiful lines of code, try out new things, and travel.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chaos Engineering and React-Redux
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning .NET and improving on Flutter
- ðŸ’» Fun Stuff

  I love to pen down my thoughts and express myself in writing. You can find my technical blogs at [dev.to/sayanide](dev.to/sayanide) and [medium.com/@sayanmondal342](medium.com/@sayanmondal342), I also share coding tutorials and my travel experiences on my [YouTube channel](youtube.com/channel/UCBYLBnGrz2YlBGKqHaiAPQQ)
